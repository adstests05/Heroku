Antoinette DeBasile, a Dominican Sister of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary, is offering what she believes to be her most valuable asset to help raise funds to rebuild the Notre-Dame cathedral of Paris.

Sr. DeBasile who entered the Dominican monastery at the age of 16, says she is ready to do anything in her power to help with the reconstruction of the sacred building considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture standing today.

“I have preserved myself all my life for my God and he has asked me to undergo the greatest sacrifice yet to help in the rebuilding of this divine monument,” she wrote in a letter addressed to the media.

“I’ve received an incredibly generous offer in the seven numbers from a rich man in Saudi Arabia who wants to stay anonymous but I’m not too fond of Muslim people in general, so I might wait for someone who shares my Catholic faith and believes in the real God, » she admitted to reporters.

Sr. DeBasile also confessed that she was anxious and apprehended putting her plan into action but that she felt she was pursuing God’s will.

“I won’t lie about the fact that I am a bit curious about the whole process,” she told reporters laughingly. “I’ve never seen a man’s penis in real life, only on the internet,” she added with humor.

Nearly 1 billion has already poured in from ordinary worshippers and high-powered magnates around the world to restore the fire-ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris after the French president set a controversial five-year deadline to get the work done."
1,Blind woman arrested after breastfeeding her guide dog in New York subway,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/blind-woman-arrested-after-breastfeeding-her-guide-dog-in-new-york-subway/,"A blind Canadian woman was arrested last night in the New York City Subway after breastfeeding her guide dog in public, causing outrage among other passengers.

53-year old Margaret Smith, from Toronto in Canada, climbed on the train with her dog at the Grand Central station around 9:30 PM last night, to get back to her hotel in the Bronx after spending the day visiting Manhattan.

Soon after getting on board, she began breastfeeding her guide dog in front of dozens of other passengers and continued despite several requests from shocked witnesses.

Other passengers eventually called the police and after she refused to cooperate. After a few minutes of confrontation, her guide dog bit a policeman, so Ms. Smith was arrested, handcuffed and taken off the train with her animal.

NYPD spokesman, Lt. Mauricio Ramirez, says the officers tried to simply convince her to stop but had no choice but to arrest her after one of them got bitten.

“The accused seemed unaware that what she was doing was illegal in this country and she showed very uncooperative. After her dog bit one of the officers, they had no choice but to arrest her.”

Ms. Smith says she had no idea that breastfeeding her guide dog in public was illegal in the United States, and says she would never have come to New York if she had known.

“In Canada, breastfeeding is a constitutional right! I’ve been breastfeeding my dogs for 25 years and never had any problems. This country is a dictatorship!”

Ms. Smith faces 14 criminal charges, including gross indecency, resisting her arrest and assault on a police officer.

If found guilty on all charges, she could face a total of 17 years in jail and a fine of $135,000. She could also be forbidden from entering the United States for 25 years.

She was released this morning after paying a $15,000 bail. Her trial is set to begin next Monday at the New York County Criminal Court."
2,"Qatar: Women’s rights activist jailed for marrying four husbands, sentenced to death",World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/qatar-womens-rights-activist-jailed-for-marrying-four-husbands-sentenced-to-death/,"A Qatari women’s rights activist has been jailed and sentenced to death by stoning after she promoted equal rights for Muslim women to also have four husbands on national television.

Shamima Ali Hussein, 22, who describes herself as an Islamic feminist, went on public television this week and explained that she had married four husbands as an act of defiance against the inequality of men and women under present government laws.

Under Sharia law, for a woman to sleep with different men is a practice that is punishable by death by Islamic law, although a man is allowed to have up to four wives according to the Quran.

“Why are the men allowed to marry four wives and not the women? Where is this written in the Quran? Allah made the same rules for everyone, so where is the problem if I have four husbands?” she said on national TV.

“Why would only men have the pleasure of fornicating with multiple partners? If my husband does not satisfy me in bed but is a good and honest worker, why could I not keep him and find myself another one to sleep with?” she wrote on her blog before her site was shut down by Qatari authorities.

The young woman has fooled four of her lovers into marrying her in the same month, an offense punishable by death by Islamic law.

Hussein is not the first self-proclaimed Islamic feminist who has fought for the right to polyandry, the practice of a woman having multiple husbands.

In 1987, Fatima Al Hamad, an 87-year-old Saudi Islamic feminist, had sex with and married 127 men on the same day and on the first day of the Holy celebration of Ramadan to raise awareness about the inequality of men and women in the public sphere, before authorities later sentenced her to decapitation."
3,Woman arrested at Apple store after inserting half-dozen stolen iPads inside her vagina,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/woman-arrested-at-apple-store-after-inserting-half-dozen-stolen-ipads-inside-her-vagina/,"Toledo, OH | An Ohio woman has been arrested after she was caught stealing several iPads at a local Apple store while attempting to hide them inside her genitals.

Surveillance cameras clearly showed Irene Lewis, 46, lifting her dress and inserting several iPads between her legs.

Security agents at Toledo’s Franklin Park Mall arrived quickly on the scene of the crime after a suspicious employee had them intercept the thief.

“I couldn’t believe she had managed to cram six iPads in there. We had to make her spread her legs wide open and check with the flashlight just to be sure there weren’t any more left,” security agent Alan Bells told reporters.

“At first she denied everything, but when we showed her the CCTV camera footage, she then admitted she had stolen the iPads and started reaching inside her vagina for them and stacking them on the table,” the security agent added.

An Apple store employee estimated the total value of the stolen goods to be well over $5000.

“She had taken two 12.9-inch display iPad Pros that go for about a thousand dollars each and four 11-inch display models that are worth nearly $800 each,” an Apple store employee confirmed.

The Franklin Park Mall Apple store manager also assured that the items in question would be “thoroughly cleaned and tested for quality reasons” before being put back on display for sale.

Irene Lewis, an unemployed single mother of four children, could face a prison term ranging from six to 12 months and a fine of not more than $2,500, say legal experts."
4,Detroit: Mother of triplets sues three different fathers for child support after she had foursome,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/mother-of-triplets-sues-three-different-fathers-for-child-support-after-she-had-foursome/,"A Detroit resident is suing three different men for child support after she gave birth to triplets last month.

Latifa G. White, 28, claims she had unprotected consensual sex with all three men after meeting them at a Detroit club.

White also admitted there was a fifth participant that night but that he only performed anal sex on her and could not be the father of her children.

During an emotional plea, White told the judge that all she wanted is the best for her children.

“Their sperm may have mixed. I’m convinced they are all the fathers since I had sex with all of them on the same night, they should all play a part in their children’s lives,” she told the judge in tears.

“I am a devout Christian and although I admit I’m ashamed of my behavior that night, I still cherish every moment of it since it brought these three miracles into my life,” she told judge Andrew Heinkemp in court.

The unemployed mother of three also admitted that she underwent a severe depression after losing her cat last year and had indulged heavily in alcohol, crystal meth and crack cocaine the night her children were conceived.

“I’ve stopped drinking and using like six months ago, I’m a good mother,” she admitted in court.

The three men did not show up in court, two of them presently being incarcerated on charges of drug trafficking and one man is presently in a drug rehab facility.

In 2011, a North Carolina resident who had sexual intercourse with several men was able to prove through DNA testing that her twins were born from fertilized eggs by sperm from a number of men at once and was eventually granted child support from five different fathers."
5,Babysitter transported to hospital after inserting a baby in her vagina,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/babysitter-transported-to-hospital-after-inserting-a-baby-in-her-vagina/,"Cincinnati, Ohio | A 31-year old woman was admitted to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center yesterday after the 14-month old toddler she was babysitting got stuck in her vaginal cavity.

Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night, reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina.

The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site.

The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening.

One of the paramedics, Brian Whitmore, related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV.

“The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas, but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the woman’s vagina.”

The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out.

“I don’t know how she got the child in there! We were both pulling as strong as we could and he wouldn’t come out.”

Ms. Brown and the child were finally transported to the hospital, where doctors were able to separate them after a delicate operation.

The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip, but doctors don’t think he will suffer any sequelae from the incident.

The babysitter was interrogated by police and confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity.

She explained that she was feeling depressed after her doctor told her she could never have children and wanted to know how it felt to give birth.

Ms. Brown now faces a total of 11 criminal charges, including aggravated child neglect causing bodily harm, and could spend up to 65 years in prison.

Her lawyer has asked for a psychiatric evaluation, claiming that she isn’t fit to stand trial.

Depending on the results of the evaluation, her trial could begin in June."
6,Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-employee-cremated-by-mistake-while-taking-a-nap/,"Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers.

According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.

While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.

Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes.

Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated.

“At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.”

Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.

The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death.

Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death.

The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death."
7,Elderly woman accused of training her 65 cats to steal from neighbors,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/elderly-woman-accused-of-training-her-65-cats-to-steal-from-neighbors/,"Columbus, Ohio | An 83-year old woman was arrested this morning and accused of training dozens of cats to steal jewelry and other valuables from her neighbors.

The Columbus Police Department opened an investigation on Ruth Gregson and her 65 cats in October after several neighbors reported small objects being stolen from their homes.

Several victims reported being visited by Ms. Gregson’s cats before noticing the disappearance of several shiny objects, like valuable cutlery and pieces of jewelry.

Despite their skepticism, investigators began a surveillance operation and were amazed by what they discovered.

According to Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs, dozens of cats were constantly coming and going, bringing home “anything that shined”.

“She was like Fagin in Oliver Twist, but she was using cats as thieves instead of children. In less than three hours of surveillance, the detectives saw the cats bring home more than a hundred objects.”

Upon searching Ms. Gregson’s house, investigators found $650,000 worth of jewelry and precious metal among piles of worthless shiny baubles.

A total of 65 adult cats and 17 kittens were found on the site and entrusted to the Columbus Humane Society.

Chief Jacobs says the elderly woman confessed to training her cats to steal, saying the felines had to “earn their meals”.

“She would only feed the animals if they brought home valuables, so the animals had to steal every day in order to survive. Most were voluntarily malnurished so they would easily gain the neighbors’ pity and be allowed inside their houses.”

According to the Columbus Police, Ms. Gregson’s animals could have stolen from more than 5,000 houses and apartment in the area, and investigators invite possible victims to contact them.

While Ms. Gregson is the first person in American history to be accused of training cats to steal, this isn’t the first time that animals are trained to commit crimes.

In 2009, a surveillance that caught a monkey stealing hundreds of dollars worth of plants from a Texas nursery.

At the time, the police and store owners had hypothesized that the monkey had been trained to take the plants and hand them over a fence to a waiting human accomplice.

In 2013, a Chicago court sentenced a man to five years in prison for training ferrets to steal cell phones from people on the street and on public buses."

Security camera footage show the three suspects during a home break-in in which the intruders entered the house through the pet door.

Authorities also believe the crime organization could be behind 55 other similar break-ins in the region.

” They found a criminal use to their small-sized bodies and used them to break-in through chimneys, pet doors and small open windows ” – Officer Ken Stevens, Boston PD

Although the Irish mob midgets officially describe themselves as a “non-profit motorcycle enthusiast group for small people of the Boston area”, several high-profile members of the organization have been arrested in the past years on charges of drug-trafficking, arson, and aggravated assault."

The Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected 54-year old Dave Murray, an employee of the Harris County Morgue, of being implicated in an organ trafficking network.

Investigating several reports of missing organs and body parts, dozens of agents raided his residence this morning, hoping to find evidence of his involvement in the crimes.

What they found on the site was a lot more disturbing than what they expected, as the FBI spokesman Andy Ramirez described the scene in an interview with WNTV-4.

“There were shelves everywhere, filled with hundreds of glass jars. Each of them contained a penis floating in formalin.”

According to Agent Ramirez, the accused rapidly confessed everything as soon as he was arrested.

“He explained in great detail how he had been cutting off dead men’s genital organs and collecting them for more than ten years.”

It took the FBI more than seven hours to gather all the organs and other pieces of evidence that were found on the site.

A total of 53 criminal charges have already been filed against Mr. Murray and hundreds more could be filed over the next few days.

An anonymous FBI source told WNTV-4 that the number of charges could reach over 3,000.

Dave Murray will remain in custody for the moment as a psychiatric evaluation has been ordered to determine if he’s fit to stand trial.

If he is considered fit, he should appear in court in October for the beginning of the procedures."
10,Couple hospitalized after man gets his head stuck in his wife’s vagina,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/couple-hospitalized-after-man-gets-his-head-stuck-in-his-wifes-vagina/,"A couple was transported to the hospital in a very awkward position last night after a man somehow got his head stuck in his wife’s vagina during a strange sexual game.

Tom and Janis Morrison, a young couple from the small town of Greensboro in Alabama, called 911 around 10:00 pm last night to ask for an ambulance.

Samantha Irving, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation.

“The woman told me that her husband had fallen and that his head was now stuck in her vaginal cavity. I really thought that it was a group of teenagers making a prank call.”

Despite Ms. Irving’s doubts, she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious.

Bill Austin, one of the paramedics who transported the couple, claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood.

“The woman kept screaming out in pain whenever the guy moved, but he had half of his face buried in there and he looked like he was going through Hell!”

The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital, where doctors were able to separate the couple.

Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable, while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises.

According to doctors, both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome.

Incidents like this one are, indeed, quite unusual, but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse.

According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 3,213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3,789 in 2016.

According to the same data, the Morrisons are the first couple to be hospitalized for a head stuck inside a vaginal cavity since October 2007."
11,Colorado: Hunter claims he was sexually assaulted by a sasquatch,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/colorado-hunter-claims-he-was-sexually-assaulted-by-a-sasquatch/,"Darrel Whitaker from Glenwood Springs in Colorado claims a sasquatch attacked him and attempted to rape him while he was walking in the woods.

The 57-year-old man was walking to his hunting cabin on Sunday to see if it had suffered any damage during the winter.

All of a sudden, a large “gorilla-like” creature dropped from a tree in front of him and punched him in the face.

“It was at least 8-foot tall and its punches hurt like hell! I was knocked right out at the first blow!”

While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls.

“When I regained consciousness, he had already torn my pants and was tearing through my underwear. I stabbed him in the shoulder with my hunting knife, and that made him run away.”

Mr. Whitaker immediately reported the attack to both the Glenwood Springs Police Department (GSPD) and the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency and a joint investigation has been launched.

Darrel Whitaker is convinced that the creature who attacked him was a sasquatch, but the GSPD investigators say it’s more probable that the attacker is simply a particularly large and hairy man.

They are currently interrogating nearby residents to see if anyone noticed an individual corresponding to the description of the suspect.

According to the victim, the attacker measure around 8-foot tall and is extremely hairy. He has brown hair, dark brown eyes, and extremely large feet.

If you possess any information concerning the suspect, please contact the Glenwood Springs Police Department or the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency."
12,Morgue worker arrested after giving birth to a dead man’s baby,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-worker-arrested-after-giving-birth-to-a-dead-mans-baby/,"Kansas City, MO | A 26-year-old morgue worker was arrested this morning after a DNA test revealed that her newborn child was the result of a necrophiliac intercourse with a man she was supposed to autopsy.

Jennifer Burrows, an assistant pathologist with the Jackson County medical examiner services, is accused of having sex with dozens of corpses over the course of the last two years, a behavior which led the birth of a baby boy on January 7.

According to the Kansas City Missouri Police Department, her baby is the son of a man who died in a car accident in March 2017, and whose body she was supposed to autopsy. They allege that Ms. Burrows sexually abused more than 60 other dead bodies, belonging to males aged from 17 to 71 years of age.

“We opened an investigation into this case in October after we were informed that the suspect may have been sexually abusing corpses,” Police Chief Forté told reporters. “We accumulated enough evidence over the last few months to obtain a warrant for a paternity test on her newborn son. It confirmed our suspicions, that the father of her child was, indeed, a 57-year old veterinarian from Texas who was driving through the county when he had a fatal car accident. All the evidence that we have gathered suggests that he had never met Ms. Burrows before his demise and that he was already dead when the baby was conceived.”

There are currently no laws (state or federal) governing or explicitly outlawing the practice of necrophilia since the corpse is considered human remains and no longer living. Therefore, it is technically legal in the state of Missouri, and Ms. Burrows’ actions are judged as an indecent treatment of a corpse.

She is facing a total of 158 charges, including indecent treatment of a corpse, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs.

The psychologists and experts that we interviewed were divided in their interpretation of Ms. Burrows’ case.

Some, like Professor Isabella Ramirez of the University of Missouri, believe that the young woman was suffering from a psychosis and had, at least partially, lost any notion of reality.

Others, like Dr. Gerald Porter, a well-known psychologist and expert in sexual disorders associated with the Institute of Psychological Sciences, believe that the accused is clearly a compulsive necrophiliac and that her choice of profession was inspired by her sexual deviation in the first place.

All seem to agree, however, that the 26-year-old woman was suffering from mental problems and that she will probably register a plea of insanity."
13,Would-be thief hospitalized after putting hot burritos up his rectum in 7-eleven store,World News Daily Report,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/would-be-thief-hospitalized-after-putting-hot-burritos-up-his-rectum-in-7-eleven-store/,"A man’s attempt to steal three burning hot burritos from a 7-eleven convenience store turned horribly wrong last night in Flint, Michigan, leading the poor man to the hospital with second and third-degree burns inside his rectal cavity.

According to witnesses, 26-year old Jason Morrison was visibly drunk when he entered the store around 10:30 PM last night to get some food.

It seems the young man was both short on money and judgment, as he decided to take three hot burritos and stuff them up his rectal cavity to carry them out of the store.

Flint Police spokesman, Lieutenant Dan Ashbury, described the following events in a press conference this morning.

“As soon as he shoved the items up his rectum, he threw himself to the ground holding his butt, and he began crying and screaming.”

Lt. Ashbury says it took witnesses a few minutes to understand what was happening and someone called 911.

“He kept screaming that his ass was burning and he was going to die. I think everyone just thought he was on drugs or suffered from violent diarrhea.”

Mr. Morrison was transported to the Mc Laren Regional Medical Center where doctors were able to extract the burritos and stabilize his condition.

He suffers from second and third-degree burns and will necessitate at least two reconstructive surgeries before he is able to defecate normally again.

Fortunately for him, since the total value of the merchandise that he stole amounts to less than 10$, no criminal charges will be filed against him."

Analak Hmong Lau, 43, was arrested this morning during a raid on his DVD store which specializes in American movies.

Amongst the titles seized by police and labeled as “homosexual propaganda” were copies of “Broke Back Mountain, Boogie Nights, Lord of the Rings and all Harry Potter movies” reports the Kalimantan Press.

“Movies promoting openly homosexual themes, gay characters or which employ gay actors portraying fictitious characters are deemed homosexual propaganda by the state,” one Brunei official told reporters.

“It is important that children are not exposed to material which makes homosexual conduct acceptable, that is why only material where homosexuality is punished, either by lashing, lapidation or torture is deemed appropriate,” one Brunei state official said.

One such child show made in partnership with the Brunei government and scheduled for next September will show Brunei’s first “openly gay muppet character” have announced the producers last month.

Keldai, a homosexual donkey, will be used to educate children on the “dangers of homosexuality and deviant manners” and “will suffer many hardships, such as lapidation, electroshock, and decapitation every show” to entice children to follow the “path of Islam” explained one producer of the upcoming show.

Brunei is a Muslim-majority former British protectorate on the north of Borneo Island with a population of around 400,000.

Early this month it began implementing Sharia laws that punish sodomy, adultery and rape with the death penalty – including by stoning, and theft with amputation."
